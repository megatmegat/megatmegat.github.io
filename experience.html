<td>My best experience was when I was able to further my studies to university. 
For me this is the best thing to happen to me because for me it is an opportunity that cannot be obtained just like that without hard work. 
Although when I first set foot into university, I was a bit stiff and nervous but now I am in semester five and want to spend my diploma time with friends</td>
